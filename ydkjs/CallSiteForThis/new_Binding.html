//        When a function is invoked with new in front of it, otherwise known as a constructor call, the following things are
// done automatically: a brand new object is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air the newly constructed object is
// [[Prototype]]-linked ,the newly constructed object is set as the this binding for that function call unless the function
// returns its own alternate object, the new-invoked function call will automatically return the newly constructed object.
// Steps 1, 3, and 4 apply to our current discussion. We'll skip over step 2 for now and come back to it in Chapter 5.
// Consider this code:
                function foo(a) {
                    this.a = a;
                }

        var bar = new foo( 2 );
        console.log( bar.a ); // 2
//        By calling foo(..) with new in front of it, we've constructed a new object and set that new object as the this for the
// call of foo(..). So new is the final way that a function call's this can be bound. We'll call this new binding.
