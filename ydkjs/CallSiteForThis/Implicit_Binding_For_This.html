//        Another rule to consider is: does the call-site have a context object, also referred to as an owning or
//        containing object, though these alternate terms could be slightly misleading. Consider:
        function foo() {
            console.log( this.a );
        }

        var obj = {
            a: 2,
            foo: foo
        };

        obj.foo(); // 2
//        Firstly, notice the manner in which foo() is declared and then later added as a reference property onto obj.
//        Regardless of whether foo() is initially declared on obj, or is added as a reference later (as this snippet
//        shows), in neither case is the function really "owned" or "contained" by the obj object.

function foo1() {
    console.log( this.a );
}

var obj2 = {
    a: 42,
    foo: foo1
};

var obj1 = {
    a: 2,
    obj2: obj2
};

obj1.obj2.foo(); // 42
//It is not 2 when obj \1 is the master caller because its obj2 which really calls this
//Here we have called fooand not foo1 because name of refrence is chang
