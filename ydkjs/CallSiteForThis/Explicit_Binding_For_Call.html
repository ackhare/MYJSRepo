         Invoking foo with explicit binding by foo.call(..) allows us to force its this to be obj. If you pass a simple
 primitive value (of type string, boolean, or number) as the this binding, the primitive value is wrapped in its
 object-form (new String(..), new Boolean(..), or new Number(..), respectively). This is often referred to as "boxing".
