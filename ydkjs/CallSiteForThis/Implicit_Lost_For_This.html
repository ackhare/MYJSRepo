//        One of the most common frustrations that this binding creates is when an implicitly bound function
//        loses that binding, which usually means it falls back to the default binding, of either the global object or
//        undefined, depending on strict mode. Consider:
        function foo() {
            console.log( this.a );
        }

        var obj = {
            a: 2,
            foo: foo
        };

        var bar = obj.foo; // function reference/alias!

        var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

        bar(); // "oops, global"
//        Even though bar appears to be a reference to obj.foo, in fact, it's really just another reference to
//        foo itself. Moreover, the call-site is what matters, and the call-site is bar(), which is a plain,
//        un-decorated call and thus the default binding applies.
