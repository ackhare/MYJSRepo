        function foo() {
            console.log( "foo" );
        }

        var someFoo = foo;  // variable reference to `foo`

        var myObject = {
            someFoo: foo
        };

        foo;                // function foo(){..}

        someFoo;            // function foo(){..}

        myObject.someFoo;   // function foo(){..}



//        someFoo and myObject.someFoo are just two separate references to the same function, and neither implies anything
//        about the function being special or "owned" by any other object. If foo() above was defined to have a this
//        reference inside it, that myObject.someFoo implicit binding would be the only observable difference between the
//        two references. Neither reference really makes sense to be called a "method".
