/*
 However, the this mechanism provides a more elegant way of implicitly "passing along" an object reference, leading to
 cleaner API design and easier re-use. The more complex your usage pattern is, the more clearly you'll see that passing
 context around as an explicit parameter is often messier than passing around a this context. When we explore objects
 and prototypes, you will see the helpfulness of a collection of functions being able to automatically reference the
 proper context object.
