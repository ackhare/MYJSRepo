        Object.create(..) creates an
  object with the [[Prototype]] linkage we're examining to the object specified.

         So, we have myObject that is now [[Prototype]] linked to anotherObject. Clearly myObject.a doesn't actually exist, but
nevertheless, the property access succeeds (being found on anotherObject instead) and indeed finds the value 2.
