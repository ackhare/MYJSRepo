         This snippet shows two additional "class-orientation" tricks in play:
         this.name = name: adds the .name property onto
 each object (a and b, respectively; see Chapter 2 about thisbinding), similar to how class instances encapsulate data
 values. Foo.prototype.myName = ...: perhaps the more interesting technique, this adds a property (function) to
 theFoo.prototype object. Now, a.myName() works, but perhaps surprisingly. How?
