       //Object.create(..) was added in ES5. You may need to support pre-ES5 environments (like older IE's),
       //so let's take a look at a simple partial polyfill for Object.create(..)
       //that gives us the capability that we need even in those older JS environments:
                if (!Object.create) {
                    Object.create = function(o) {
                        function F(){}
                        F.prototype = o;
                        return new F();
                    };
                }
       //This polyfill works by using a throw-away F function and overriding its .prototype property
       // to point to the object we want to link to. Then we use new F() construction to make a new object
       // that will be linked as we specified.
