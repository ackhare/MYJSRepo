        Foo.prototype = { /* .. */ }; // create a new prototype object


        var a1 = new Foo();
        //The below holds only when line number 10 holds
        console.log(a1.constructor === Foo); // false!
        console.log(a1.constructor === Object); // true!
/*
 What's happening? a1 has no .constructor property, so it delegates up the [[Prototype]] chain to Foo.prototype. But that
object doesn't have a .constructor either (like the default Foo.prototype object would have had!), so it keeps
delegating, this time up to Object.prototype, the top of the delegation chain. That object indeed has a .constructor on
it, which points to the built-in Object(..) function.
