    /*
when the function is invoked windows will take place of global We pass in the window object reference, but we name the
parameter global, so that we have a clear stylistic delineation for global vs. non-global references. Of course, you can
pass in anything from an enclosing scope you want, and you can name the parameter(s) anything that suits you. This is
mostly just stylistic choice.
