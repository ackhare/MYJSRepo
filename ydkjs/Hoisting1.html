/*What do you expect to be printed in the console.log(..) statement?
Many developers would expect undefined, since the var a statement comes after the a = 2,
and it would seem natural to assume that the variable is re-defined,
and thus assigned the default undefined. However, the output will be 2.

//Consider another piece of code:
console.log( b );

var b = 2;
/*
 You might be tempted to assume that, since the previous snippet exhibited some less-than-top-down looking behavior,
 perhaps in this snippet, 2 will also be printed. Others may think that since the a variable is used before it is
 declared, this must result in a ReferenceError being thrown. Unfortunately, both guesses are incorrect. undefined is
 the output.
