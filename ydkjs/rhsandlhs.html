/*
 When the RHS look-up occurs for b the first time, it will not be found. This is said to be an "undeclared" variable,
because it is not found in the scope. If an RHS look-up fails to ever find a variable, anywhere in the nested Scopes,
this results in a ReferenceError being thrown by the Engine. It's important to note that the error is of the type
ReferenceError. By contrast, if the Engine is performing an LHS look-up, and it arrives at the top floor (global Scope)
without finding it, if the program is not running in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], then the global Scope will create
a new variable of that name in the global scope, and hand it back to Engine.
