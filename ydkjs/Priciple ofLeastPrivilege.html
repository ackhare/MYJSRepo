In this snippet, the b variable and the doSomethingElse(..) function are likely "private" details of how doSomething(..)
does its job. Giving the enclosing scope "access" to b and doSomethingElse(..) is not only unnecessary but also possibly
"dangerous", in that they may be used in unexpected ways, intentionally or not, and this may violate pre-condition
assumptions of doSomething(..).
 Above is bad design

 Now, b and doSomethingElse(..) are not accessible to any outside influence, instead controlled only by doSomething(..).
The functionality and end-result has not been affected, but the design keeps private details private, which is usually
considered better software.
