       // Consider code which attempts (and fails!) to cross over the boundary and use this to implicitly refer
       // to a function's lexical scope:
        function foo() {
            var a = 2;
            this.bar();
        }

        function bar() {
            console.log( this.a );
        }

        foo(); //undefined
//        There's more than one mistake in this snippet. While it may seem contrived, the code you see is a distillation
// of actual real-world code that has been exchanged in public community help forums.
// It's a wonderful (if not sad) illustration of just how misguided this assumptions can be.
//                Firstly, an attempt is made to reference the bar() function via this.bar(). It is almost certainly an
//             accident that it works, but we'll explain the how of that shortly. The most natural way to have invoked
//             bar() would have been to omit the leading this. and just make a lexical reference to the identifier.
//             However, the developer who writes such code is attempting to use this to create a bridge between the
//             lexical scopes of foo() and bar(), so that bar() has access to the variable a in the inner scope of foo().
//             No such bridge is possible. You cannot use a this reference to look something up in a lexical scope. It is
//             not possible. Every time you feel yourself trying to mix lexical scope look-ups with this, remind yourself:
//             there is no bridge.
