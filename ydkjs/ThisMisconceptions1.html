// foo.count is still 0, even though the four console.log statements clearly indicate foo(..) was in fact called four
// times. The frustration stems from a too literal interpretation of what this (in this.count++) means. When the code
// executes foo.count = 0, indeed it's adding a property count to the function object foo. But for the this.count
// reference inside of the function, this is not in fact pointing at all to that function object, and so even though the
// property names are the same, the root objects are different, and confusion ensues.


        //created a global variable count  and it currently has the value NaN. O
