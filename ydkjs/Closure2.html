        /*
         The spirit of this code snippet is that we would normally expect for the behavior to be that the numbers "1", "2", .. "5" would be printed out, one at a time, one per second, respectively.
         In fact, if you run this code, you get "6" printed out 5 times, at the one-second intervals.

         The timeout function callbacks are all running well after the completion of the loop. In fact, as timers go, even if it
was setTimeout(.., 0) on each iteration, all those function callbacks would still run strictly after the completion of
the loop, and thus print 6 each time.

What's missing is that we are trying to imply that each iteration of the loop "captures" its own copy of i, at
the time of the iteration. But, the way scope works, all 5 of those functions, though they are defined
separately in each loop iteration, all are closed over the same shared global scope, which has, in fact, only
one i in it. Put that way, of course all functions share a reference to the same i. Something about the loop
structure tends to confuse us into thinking there's something else more sophisticated at work. There is not.
There's no difference than if each of the 5 timeout callbacks were just declared one right after the other,
with no loop at all.
