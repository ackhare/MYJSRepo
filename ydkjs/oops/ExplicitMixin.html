//        Let's again revisit our Vehicle and Car example from before. Since JavaScript will not automatically copy behavior from
//Vehicle to Car, we can instead create a utility that manually copies. Such a utility is often called extend(..)  by many
//libraries/frameworks, but we will call it mixin(..) here for illustrative purposes.
        // vastly simplified `mixin(..)` example:
        function mixin( sourceObj, targetObj ) {
            for (var key in sourceObj) {
                // only copy if not already present
                if (!(key in targetObj)) {
                    targetObj[key] = sourceObj[key];
                }
            }

            return targetObj;
        }

        var Vehicle = {
            engines: 1,

            ignition: function() {
                console.log( "Turning on my engine." );
            },

            drive: function() {
                this.ignition();
                console.log( "Steering and moving forward!" );
            }
        };

        var Car = mixin( Vehicle, {
            wheels: 4,

            drive: function() {
                Vehicle.drive.call( this );//to print vehicle statement
                console.log( "Rolling on all " + this.wheels + " wheels!" );//4
            }
        } );
console.log('mmm');
        console.log(Car.drive());
/*
 Now, let's examine how mixin(..) works. It iterates over the properties of sourceObj (Vehicle in our example) and if
there's no matching property of that name in targetObj (Car in our example), it makes a copy. Since we're making the
copy after the initial object exists, we are careful to not copy over a target property.
