        We now obviously have more lexical scope. Each timeout function callback is indeed closing over its own
       per-iteration scope created respectively by each IIFE. It's not enough to have a scope to close over if that
       scope is empty. Look closely. Our IIFE is just an empty do-nothing scope. It needs something in it to be useful
       to us.
