/*
Sometimes subscript syntax can be very useful because the key is indexed with a string.
The string can be built at runtime to access an objectâ€™s properties without knowing exactly what properties
it has.
For example you could use a foreach loop to iterate through each property in the object or
dynamically build the property name:
*/



 for(var property in rufus)
     alert(rufus[property].toString());
 var myObject = {
     property1: "chocolate",
     property2: "cake",
     property3: "brownies"
 }
 for(var x=1; x&lt;4; x++)
     alert(myObject["property" + x]);
